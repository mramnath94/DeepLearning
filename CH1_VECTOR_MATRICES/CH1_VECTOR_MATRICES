VECTORS
Euclidean space:
  The space of n dimensions where the distance between any two points is given by the distance
formula sqrt(sum(x^2, y^2, ...etc))
Dot Product: 
  Reference - https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html
  u and v are of the same dimensions
  u.v = u(transpose)*v
Unit vectors:
Any vector with a magnitude of 1.
  Coordinate axes vectors, i(1,0,0), j(0,1,0), k(0,0,1) etc
  (1/√3,1/√3,1/√3) is also a unit vector as its magnitude is 1
  Any vector with a magnitude != 1 can yield a unit vector if we take the vector and scalar divide it by its own magnitude
Projection of one vector onto another:
  https://byjus.com/vector-projection-formula/
  Projyx = (x.y/||y|| )y
Angle between two vectors:
  Cosθ = (x.y)/ |||x|| ||y|||
Orthogonal vectors θ = 90
  Cosθ = 0
  (x.y)/ |||x|| ||y||| = 0
  (x.y) = 0
Why do we care about vectors:
  Very useful to represent features of our dataset as a collection of numbers in a vector format
  For eg: Phone specs as a vector, Image as a collection of numbers in vector form


MATRICES
Introduction to matrices:
  It is a collection of column vectors or a collection of row vectors
  m = No. of rows
  n = No. of columns
  Addition of two matrices:
  m1 == m2
  n1 == n2
Multiplying a vector by a matrix:
  Row-by-column method: dot product of each row of a matrix with the column of the vector
  Number of columns in the matrix should be equal to the number of rows in the vector
  mxn * nx1
  Yields mx1 dimension vector
Multiplying a matrix by another matrix
  Same Row-by-column method: dot product of each row of m1 with each column of m2
  Number of columns of m1 should be equal to the number of rows of m2
  mxn * nxo
  Yields mxo dimension matrix
Alternative way of multiplying two matrices:
  Linear combination of the columns of the matrix
Why do we care about matrices:
  Used to create a matrix of features
  m = No of training examples
  n = Number of features in each training example
