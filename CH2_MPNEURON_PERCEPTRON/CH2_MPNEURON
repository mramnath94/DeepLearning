MP Neuron Model
What is the mathematical model?
  1. Inputs belong to a discrete set of values {0,1}
  2. g aggregates the inputs and function f takes a decision based on these aggregations
  3. These inputs can be excitatory or inhibitory
  a. y = 0 if xi is inhibitory (outputs zero, sort of an override), else
  b. g(x) = i = 1 to n, summation x(i)
  c. y = f(g(x))
    i. y = 1 if g(x) >= b
    ii. y = 0 if g(x) < b
    iii. Where b is a threshold value
    iv. b is a parameter, it is adjusted with the aim of maximizing the number of correct predictions
  Consider the example of LBW prediction where inputs are Pitch in line(x1) Impact(x2) Missing Stumps(x3) and output (y) is to predict if its LBW or not..

MP Neuron Loss
How do we compute the loss
  1. Take the square of the difference to ignore the sign.
  2. cost/loss = summation of squares of differences between predicted and actual output.  

MP Neuron Learning Algorithm - How do we train our model
  1. In this case, we have only one parameter, so we can afford to use brute force search.
    a. Here, consider we have n features
    b. b can only range from 0 to n, else it would be a pointless parameter
    c. b has discrete values only, as the inputs are also discrete values

MP Neuron Evaluation
  1.Accuracy = No. of correct predictions/ Total No. of predictions (¾ = 75% in test set)

MP Neuron - Geometric Basics
  1. Chapter on geometry basics, a brush-up.
  2. x2 = mx1 + c
  3. In 2D: General form ax1 + bx2 + c = 0
    a. Consider a = 2, b = 1, c = -2
    b. The intercepts are 1 and 2
    c. Consider the point (1,2), plugging it into the equation gives us the value 2
    d. If ax1 + bx2 + c > 0 then it is above the line
    e. If ax1 + bx2 + c < 0 then it is below the line
    f. If ax1 + bx2 + c = 0 then it is on the line
  4. In 3D: General form ax1 + bx2 + cx3 + d = 0
    a. If ax1 + bx2 + cx3 + d > 0 then it is above the line
    b. If ax1 + bx2 + cx3 + d < 0 then it is below the line
    c. If ax1 + bx2 + cx3 + d = 0 then it is on the line

MP Neuron Geometric Interpretation
  1. In 2D: ax1 + bx2 + d = 0
    a. x2 = -(a/b)x1 - (d/b)
    b. x2 = mx1 + c
    c. Where m = -a/b
    d. c = -d/b
  2. MP Neuron model in 2D can be rewritten as
    a. x1 + x2 - b >= 0 (decision boundary)
    b. Positive predictions(1) yield a value >= 0 and lie above the decision boundary
    c. Negative predictions(0) yield a value < 0 and lie below the decision boundary
  3. This is a very restrictive model with respect to the freedom it has due to only  one parameter  
  4. Some downsides to this model 
  a. Boolean inputs and outputs 
  b. The model is linear  
  c. The model has a fixed slope
  d. The model has few possible intercepts(b’s)

MP Neuron Summary
  1. Data: All boolean inputs ☹
  2. Task: Binary classification (boolean output) ☹
  3. Model: Linear decision boundary, all +ve points lie above the line ane -ve points are below (minimum flexibility) ☹
  4. cost/loss: mean squared error
  5. Learning: brute force approach to learn best parameter b ☹
  6. Evaluation: Accuracy
