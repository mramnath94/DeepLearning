1. Learning by guessing - Its not going to work always and for large datasets / features it is very tough
  1. Steps:
    a. Initialise: w,b to 0
    b. Iterate over Data: guess_and_update(xi)
      i. w = w + 𝚫w
      ii. b = b + 𝚫b
      iii. Here, 𝚫w and 𝚫b are the amounts we change w and b, by pure guess-work. We need to design a function to replace the guess-work.
    c. Till satisfied

2. Concepts 
  Cost function ( y = x^2), Tangential slope, Learning rate, Derivatives (Power rule and Chain rule), Partial derivatives
